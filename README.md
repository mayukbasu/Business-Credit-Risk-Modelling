# Business-Credit-Risk-Modelling


Create new visualization in exploration

Try out different models and test sizes

Use all visualizations to test model (cost function, etc.)

Make sure the data always outputs the same thing.

# We will be build a credit card fraud detection model. The goals of this notebook are the following:

Show how to create a fraud detection system

Explain how to deal with imbalanced datasets

Use a wide variety of models to get a better understanding of which ones work better

Use Semi-Supervised Classification

# Problem Statement:

Credit card fraud is a problem where some of the credit card transactions turn out to be fraud. Credit card companies would like to reduce the risks of fraud in order to reduce the costs associated. Our model's aim is to try to eliminate fraudulent transactions.
